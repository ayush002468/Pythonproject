Task implementation using flask , Mongodb , python

Steps involved

1.) Created a blank python project in pycharm

2.) installed MongoDb

3.) for flask imported flask lib

4.) for database creation created a database naming api and collection naming appoinment.

5.) after that created a cluster on mongo db server with my name 

6.) next step in that cluster clicked on connect option and choosen the option connect to application option.

7.) connect to application option gives a url which i pasted in the code which is a mongodb connection string.

8.) initialised mongoengine

9.) created a class named appoinment which would act as a collection and will push the data to that collection

10.) for converting it to json made a property 

11.) created api requests for get and post method which will populate the data in the db.

12.) using post man inserted the data using post method using url(http://127.0.0.1:5000/Api/db_populate)

13.) using postman used get method to get the data using url(http://127.0.0.1:5000/Api/Appointment)

note- there was some error in connection string. connection gets established but at the same time gets closed.

note- I had to use date only format but as i am new to mongo so tried using through normal intField.
